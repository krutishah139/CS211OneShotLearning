# CS211 OneShotLearning

Simple “one-shot” machine learning algorithm for predicting house prices based on historical data received from input files. The algorithm utilized Guass-Jorden
elimination for finding inverses which called for complex dynamic memory allocation. 

Written as an assignment for Rutger Computer Architecture(CS211) with Professor David Menendez.
